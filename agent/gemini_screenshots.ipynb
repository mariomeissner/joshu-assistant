      "\n",
      "2. **Assess Importance:**  Prioritize the client meeting given past lessons about client importance.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Propose an Alternative (if possible):** Before involving your boss, see if you can propose an alternative time to the client that works for you.  Check your calendar for any free slots on the same day or a nearby day.  Even a slightly earlier or later time might work.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Communicate Clearly with Client:**  Reply promptly to the client acknowledging their request and proposing your alternative time, if you found one. If not, explain the conflict and ask for their availability for a different time slot. Be professional and courteous.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Consult your Boss (if necessary):**  If you can't find a suitable alternative, *then* email your boss (with a clear subject line, not \"What should I do??\"). Briefly explain the conflict, the times involved, and the importance of the client. Suggest a potential solution if you have one (e.g., shortening the internal meeting, delegating part of it).\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Avoid unnecessary actions:** You've previously wasted time hovering over emails and calendar entries excessively.  Focus on direct actions to resolve the conflict efficiently. Don't overthink or hesitate.\n",
