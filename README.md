# Joshu Assistant: A Gemini-powered Email Interaction Predictor

This project is a demo for the Inception Studio Hackathon in Tokyo (November 17th).  It uses Google's Gemini AI model to analyze screenshots of email client interactions, learn user behavior patterns, and predict future actions within the email client.

## Project Overview

Joshu Assistant aims to improve email workflow efficiency by predicting user actions based on past interactions.  The system captures screenshots of email client usage, processes these images using the Gemini API to extract relevant information, and builds a knowledge base of user actions and intentions. This knowledge base is then used to predict the user's likely next action in similar situations.

## Data Sources

The primary data source for this project is a series of screenshots capturing user interactions with an email client (likely Outlook, based on the code).  These screenshots are processed to extract information about the user's actions and the context of the interaction.

## Model Details

The project utilizes the `gemini-1.5-pro-latest` Generative AI model from Google.

## Dependencies

The project requires the following Python libraries:

* `google-generativeai`
* `google-cloud-aiplatform` (appears to be used for deployment, based on the code)
* `python-dotenv`
* `pillow`
* `ipykernel`
* `fastapi`
* `uvicorn`
* `python-multipart`
* `numpy`
* ... (other dependencies may exist; check `requirements.txt`)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:** `git clone <repository_url>`
2. **Navigate to the project directory:** `cd joshu-assistant`
3. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**  (Instructions may vary depending on your system; see `agent/setup-env.sh` for a potential example)
4. **Install dependencies:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. **Obtain a Gemini API Key:**  [Provide instructions on how to obtain a Gemini API key]
6. **Set environment variables:** Set the `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable to your API key.  (e.g., `export GEMINI_API_KEY=<your_api_key>`)

## Usage

1. **Prepare input images:** Place screenshots of email interactions in the `agent/final_images` directory.  Ensure the images are named sequentially (e.g., `01.png`, `02.png`, etc.).
2. **Run the main notebook:** Execute the `agent/gemini_screenshots.ipynb` notebook.  This notebook will process the images, generate a knowledge base, and demonstrate the predictive capabilities of the assistant.

## Output

The assistant outputs predictions about the user's next action in the email client, based on the analyzed screenshots and the generated knowledge base.  The output format is likely text (see the code for details).

## Future Work

* Complete the FastAPI server for a more user-friendly interface.
* Improve the knowledge base generation process for better accuracy and scalability.
* Integrate with other applications and services.
* Add more robust error handling and logging.
